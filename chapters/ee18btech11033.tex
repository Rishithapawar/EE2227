\item Plot the polar plot of 
\begin{align}
G(s) = \frac{1}{(s+1)(s+2)(s+3)}. 
\end{align}

\solution
For polar plot we have to plot magnitude of $G(s)$ versus its phase
by varying $\omega$ from 0 to $\infty$.

\item How to tell about the stability of a closed loop system based on the polar plot?

\solution
The polar plots are for open loop transfer function,hence the reference point for determining stability is shifted to (-1,0).
\begin{description}[font=$\bullet$~\normalfont\scshape\color{red!50!black}]

\item If (-1,0) is to the left of the polar plot then the closed loop system is stable.
\item If (-1,0) is on the right side of the polar plot then the closed loop system is unstable.
\item If t(-1,0) is on the polar plot then the closed loop system is marginally stable.
\end{description}
\end{enumerate}
