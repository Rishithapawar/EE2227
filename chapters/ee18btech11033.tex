\item Plot the polar plot of 
\begin{align}
G(s) = \frac{1}{(s+1)(s+2)(s+3)}. 
\end{align}

\solution
For polar plot we have to plot magnitude of $G(s)$ versus its phase
by varying $\omega$ from 0 to $\infty$.

\item Consider the above open loop transfer function
\begin{align}
G(s) = \frac{1}{(s+1)(s+2)(s+3)}.
\end{align}
Is the system stable(using polar plot)?

\solution
The polar plots are for open loop transfer function,hence the reference point for determining stability is shifted to (-1,0).
Since for the above question (-1,0) is not enclosed by polar plot,the closed loop system is stable.
